## What is the goal of NSC-R?

NSC-R is an interdisciplinary community at NSCR dedicated to promoting a fun and supportive culture of co-learning in data science skills and open science principles. We host workshops and social events where attendees can learn and work on projects among friends and colleagues. NSC-R welcomes everyone who wants to better their know-how in all things data, regardless of skill level. We want to replace statistics anxiety and code fear with inspiration and motivation to learn and share.
